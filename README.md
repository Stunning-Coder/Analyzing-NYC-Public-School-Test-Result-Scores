# [Introduction](#Introduction)
> Every year, school test results play a role in deciding the fate of millions of students. The SAT is a major part of the college admissions process in America.
> In this project, you will work with a SQL database containing test performances from NYC's public schools.

# [Project Description](#ProjectDescription)
To be able to take on this project, I needed to have learned:

### Courses:
- [Introduction to SQL](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-sql)
- [Intermediate SQL](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intermediate-sql)
- [Functions for Manipulating Data in PostgreSQL](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/functions-for-manipulating-data-in-postgresql)

### Concepts:
- Data Manipulation
- Data Importation
- Data Cleaning
- Case Study

# [Goals](#Goals)
In taking on this project, I was trying to:
-  look at how performance varies by borough,
-  identify how many schools fail to report information,
-  and find the top (ten) performing schools across the city of **New York**!

# [Conclusion](#Conclusion)
> The project investigated student performances by boroughs in New York City for the SAT exams, a major exam in the United States. Staten Island was the borough with the best scores compared to others.

Overall, it was a great experience.:+1:
